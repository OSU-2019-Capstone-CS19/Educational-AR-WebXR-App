        <p id="description">This is an educational Solar System Augmented Reality application. Once you are in, place the solar system in a suitable location that is defined by a blue circle that comes up where you are pointing the camera. You will be able to explore our solar system by touching planets or using the onscreen interface. Keep your eyes open for some "fun facts", there may be some use to them later down the road. Press the "Start AR" button at any time to begin your journey.</p>
